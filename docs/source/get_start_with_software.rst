Install Arduino IDE
---------------------

Arduino is an open source platform that applies simple software and hardware. You can get it in a short even when you know little of it. It provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for code editing and compiling, compatible with multiple control boards. So you can just download the Arduino IDE, upload the sketches (i.e. the code files) to the board, and then you can see experimental phenomena. For more information, refer to http://www.arduino.cc. 

The code in this kit is written based on Arduino, so you need to install the IDE first. Skip it if you have done this.

**Step 1:** Go to the arduino.cc website and click Download. On the page, check the software list on the right side under Download the Arduino Software.
